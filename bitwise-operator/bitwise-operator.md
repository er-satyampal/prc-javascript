JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Operator	Name	Description
&	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
>>>	Zero fill right shift	Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
Examples
Operation	Result	Same as	Result
5 & 1	1	0101 & 0001	 0001
5 | 1	5	0101 | 0001	 0101
~ 5	10	 ~0101	 1010
5 << 1	10	0101 << 1	 1010
5 ^ 1	4	0101 ^ 0001	 0100
5 >> 1	2	0101 >> 1	 0010
5 >>> 1	2	0101 >>> 1	 0010






The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned binary numbers. Because of this ~ 5 returns 10.

Since JavaScript uses 32 bits signed integers, it will not return 10. It will return -6.

A signed integer uses the leftmost bit as the minus sign.
