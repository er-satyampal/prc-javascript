        Array indexes start with 0:

[0] is the first array element
[1] is the second
[2] is the third ...

 we have given these value already..
 but still we wants to be create a new intities at the place of "0".
 then previous value will be replaced... 
       (if we don't have given the pre-value then..
       it will crealte a new work space on that place. )
